    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped
        onions and sauté until they become translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot, and sauté for an
        additional minute until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, chopped red and green bell peppers, thyme,
        curry powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook the mixture for about 5-7
        minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice with the tomato
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 20-25
        minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: If using diced chicken, fish, or other protein, add it to the
        pot about halfway through the cooking process and cook until fully
        cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and let it sit for a few
        minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
